# SARS_3c_Cornavirus_ProteinBioactivityScreening-
SARS_3c_Cornavirus_ProteinBioactivityScreening  using Rdkit-A machine learning tool kit with molecular descriptors
 This is an Advances in Bioinformatics Project supervised by Dr Farrukh Azeem atTomsk State University   - Computational Drug Discovery Download Bioactivity Data**
In this Jupyter notebook, I will be building a real-life **Drug dicovery Bioinformatics Project.Particularly, I will be building a machine learning model for classifiying for  identifying compounds Bioactivity  towards SARS_3c_Cornavirus_Protein  using the ChEMBL bioactivity database.USUALLY, THE GOAL OF DRUG DISCOVERY IS TO FIND A COMPOUND OR MOLECULE THAT WILL BE ABLE TO INHIBIT/EFFECT THE FUNCTION OF A PROTEIN. This prediction can be initiated using Machine learning models.

The dataset(On SARS CORONAVIRUS 3clike protein ) used in this work were fetched from Chembl database
ChEMBL Database
The ChEMBL Database is a database that contains curated bioactivity data of more than 2 million compounds. It is compiled from more than 76,000 documents, 1.2 million assays and the data spans 13,000 targets and 1,800 cells and 33,000 indications.
